		Clinical risk prediction models predict the presence of a specific disease or the occurrence of a future health-related event. They are data-driven tools based on statistical or machine learning models, designed to help healthcare professionals or patients with clinical decision-making. The typical methodology to develop and assess prediction models consists of consecutive research phases: development, internal and external validation of predictive performance, assessment of clinical impact (e.g. in RCTs), and finally implementation in care. With the rising popularity of AI, many expect clinical risk prediction models will also thrive.
In this presentation, we scrutinize the current state of clinical prediction research. We will draw on the findings of two large-scale literature reviews. In the first review, we conducted a broad systematic search of bibliographic databases to estimate the number of and rise in prediction model development publications over time. A random subsample of these is followed up longitudinally to quantify how often model validation, impact assessment, and implementation are carried out. In the second review, we zoom in on the prognosis of covid-19. We will see how failure to consider the medical context in which the model will be applied, and cutting corners methodologically, make most developed prediction models unfit for clinical practice. Finally, we offer recommendations to advance the field.

Research institutions, journals, and individual scientists have financial, reputational and legal interests in obstructing self-correction and reproduction efforts. This talk will describe common experiences among whistleblowers and critics who take on such interests, and propose steps they and the community can take to facilitate self-correction and reproduction without unfairly or excessively harming individuals whose career progress is bound up with unsupported scientific claims.

	<i>Kate Christian (University of Sydney)</i> <strong>Bullying and questionable research practices: the high tolls of an overly competitive environment in academic science</strong>. In the academic science environment in Australia we have identified unacceptable levels of undesirable workplace characteristics including bullying and harassment and questionable research practices. The perpetrators of these practices are most often the supervisors or another senior colleague, people in a position of power over the victims. I will share stories of the impact on early career researchers and on whistleblowers, both from my own experience and from my research, and call for the establishment of an Australian Office of Academic Research Integrity.

	<i>A/Prof Raffaella Demichelis (on behalf of the EMCR Forum of the Australian Academy of Science)</i> <strong>The EMCR Forum: 12 years of bringing diverse voices to the decision-making tables</strong>. This presentation will introduce the EMCR Forum - who they are and what they do - and will showcase some of the Forum’s advocacy goals and achievements on the need to redefine success, career structures and workload models. Bringing the voice of EMCRs and the diversity of their voices to the tables where decisions are made is a delicate and precarious task. However, a national network that has no direct link with its members’ employers is by nature a much safer and freer space than a regular workplace, and the support of an organisation like the Australian Academy of Science can empower the network to achieve major milestones and amplify their voice. With this presentation, the EMCR Forum hope to initiate discussion with the audience, welcoming ideas and feedback on future advocacy goals and approaches.

    <p>Meta-Research Open Review (MetaROR) is a platform in development by AIMOS and RoRI, the Research on Research Institute. One aim is to fill a gap. Meta-research is a rapidly growing field, but few to no journals are directly associated with it. MetaRoR aims to provide a free platform where meta-researchers can communicate with each other, in a place owned by scholars, one that is progressive on open research and peer review innovation. The core activity of MetaROR will be coordinating and publishing peer review of preprints related to meta-research. Traditional funding agencies also intend to work with MetaROR to improve their funding and research evaluation processes. </p> 
<p>MetaROR aims to develop a community of both authors and of journals that will be associated with the platform (similar to the Peer Community In model). After MetaROR has curated peer review of a preprint, the authors are free to submit that preprint, together with the reviews, to traditional journals. In this discussion, we will lay out MetaROR’s vision in more detail and ask for input on issues such as community development, editorial policy, and how to bridge the several disciplines involved, including meta-science, philosophy of science, science studies, and policy-making.</p>

        We are a species of information foragers. Individually and collectively, we have evolved to scour our natural and social environments for useful information. Over the past twenty years, society has fashioned the web into an information pipeline to satisfy and profit from our evolved desires for novel information and social connection. What happens when the scale of human communication is radically transformed in the span of the generation, and our mechanisms for creating collective understanding are upended? What happens when this entire process is not stewarded to promote the spread of accurate information, strengthen democracy, and advance human well-being—but rather is engineered by machine learning algorithms to get people to click on advertisements? What happens when large language models such as ChatGPT enter this global conversation with massive volumes of customized text indistinguishable from that produced by humans?
In this talk, I’ll look at what social media and information technology more generally are doing to society, consider how we ended up here, and explore some possible suggestions for what we can do about it.
