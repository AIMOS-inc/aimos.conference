    <h2>Technical Critique Workshop: venues, approaches, risks and consequences.</h2>

<p><i>Eugenie Reich (Eugenie Reich Law LLC)</i></p>

<p>This workshop will tackle the options that exist in the scientific community for publicizing candid technical critiques and takedowns of flawed and fraudulent research. 
We will discuss communication problems and legal and ethical issues at stake in a critic or whistleblower's choice of forum: from personal email to group meetings to conferences to preprint servers to journals to the news media to social media to the courts. 
We will also discuss different approaches that critics can take in presenting their data or theoretical analysis and the different kinds of language that they may use to convey what they think went through. 
Finally we will study some real-life examples of different technical critiques (which I will share on handouts for those there in person) and talk about the content, the style of presentation, what the individual and community ramifications might have been of sending the critique into the world, and what types of follow up should happen from different parties involved. 
An important theme is to what extent one should just say what one thinks versus consider the trade-off with the risks and consequences of harsh critiques for individuals (both critics and targets of criticism), institutions, funders and research fields.</p>
