                		Scientific research is built on the idea that evidence can clinch a question. Evidence can, in theory, support or falsify any of our ideas. But when reading the scientific literature, one finds numerous examples of questions, often important ones, that only appear to have been addressed with evidence: upon closer inspection, the studies are so low in quality, so misconceived in their design, or so outweighed by unpublished research that they provide no reliable answers whatsoever.
Some authors have argued that this leaves us with a “vast graveyard of undead theories” – scientific ideas that remain popular, but which are impervious to falsification because of our aversion to publishing high-quality, definitive studies.
Conversely, though, others have noted that the poor quality of much of the scientific literature makes it unstable and vulnerable to the sudden, drastic falsification of ideas. This includes the idea of a “medical reversal”, where the consensus on a clinical treatment rapidly flips upon the publication of a study that’s much better than anything published previously.
Are these ideas in conflict? In this talk I’ll discuss the many problems that arise from the proliferation of low-quality studies, and suggest ways that meta-science and open science could help us exorcise our undead theories and build a literature we can rely on.
