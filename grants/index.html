    <h2>Grants</h2>
	
	<p>A small number of AU$1000 travel grants will be available to support in-person attendance at AIMOS2023. 
	Due to the high interest in these grants, we will give priority to:</p>
<ul>
<li>early career researchers (five years post-PhD) and/or those who have experienced career interruptions</li>
<li>mini-note speakers</li>
<li>people outside of Brisbane</li>
<li>attendees who have submitted a proposal by the closing date for submissions (Tuesday 3rd October) </li>
<li>attendees from lower-middle-income countries</li>
<li>attendees with involvement in the meta-research community (e.g., previous AIMOS volunteer)</li>
</ul>

<p>When submitting your proposal, you will have an opportunity to apply for the travel grant, including a brief outline of your circumstances and motivation to attend AIMOS2023. 
If you have been invited for a mini note, please email the organisers if you are interested in a Travel Grant.</p>

<p>In the event that we have equally good applications that we cannot cover with the available budget, we will randomly order the applications and fund them in order until the budget is exhausted.</p>
